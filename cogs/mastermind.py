#===============================================================================
# Description
# ..............................................................................
# mastermind.py plays a one-player game of Mastermind. A four-digit code is
# generated and the player must guess it within ten guesses, only getting the
# feedback of how many digits were in the code and in the correct position.
# Score is awarded relative to how few guesses it took and we keep a leaderboard
# for best streak and highest lifetime score.
