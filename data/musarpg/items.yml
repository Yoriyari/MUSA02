# Items have several attributes used to compute their traits and combat effectiveness, e.g.
# - Pointiness (very pointy like spears)
# - Sharpness (sharp like blades, razors)
# - Firmness (floppy like plushie, firm like mace)
# - Flammability?
# - Weight (integer. modifies inventory capacity, bludgeoning damage...)
#
# Other attributes are mostly just cosmetics, like
# - Shape ("shaped like a pumpkin", primarily for custom crafts)
# - Colour (blue, black, etc)
# - ...
#
# Player stats contribute to combat effectiveness too, like strength.
